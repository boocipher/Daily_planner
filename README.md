# Daily Planner
MoodyFoody is a simple calendar app that allows you to save events for each hour of the day. The app runs in the browser and has dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. It is limited to standard business hours, so the user can enter events between 8 am and 5 pm for each hour. To help the user easily navigate the page, the current hour slot is red, the upcoming slots are green, while any past time slots are grey. When the user clicks the save button for that particular hour, the events are saved into local storage so that if the user refreshes the app webpage, they don't lose all their saved events.
